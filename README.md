**InspirationðŸŒ **

Today, Internet is full of Articles ,Blogs. Everyone Content Creator add other links in their blog which is shorten Link and this make me curious about how short link create, it inspires me a lot to make something similar to, day today's apps like Bit.ly.
                               
**What it doesðŸš€**

URL SHORTENING APP(commonly abbreviated to bit.ly)[is a Url-shortening social web app platform]. This app allows users to shorten the Url and maintain the count of the visit to the link. Link can be shared with friends or other people in any social app. It is a link management platform that lets you harness the power of your links by shortening, sharing, managing, and analyzing links to your content. It is a full-stack web application, we made using the MERN stack. It first opens with a login screen, a user needs to log in if an account exists or needs to create an account and if new to the platform, after successful signup it redirects the user to the login screen and now the user needs to login, that's how the auth works. Now after the login home screen appears with a textarea where the user is able to write the long Url and Url shortener buttons. After the user clicks on a button, the Table will show which contains longurl, shorturl, and No of time visit. 
                                                                                                                                
**How We Built itðŸ”¨**
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                  
I started by creating a prototype in Figma. The mobile application was built using MERN stack and VS-Studio as a tool. We made use of JWT(javascript web token) for authentication and for saving user data. I used Hashing  for secured the Paasword. I used Tailwind Library to style the project. And Finally deployed on Heroku.


**Challenges We ran intoðŸŸ **

I was very new to JWT authentication and Hashing  the Password, I find it difficult to integrate it with the web app, then at deployment time(It was my first deployment with Heroku) too much difficulty arises because of secure keys, which was very new to me and I was not aware of, how to hide them before production.


**What I learnedðŸ“š**


I got more experience in MERN stack and JWT by building this application. Got to learn about different authentication systems and how everything interacts in the web application during auth. Learned How to secure the Web apps by attacking and secure the Database.
